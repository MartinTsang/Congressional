# Congressional App Challenge Submission / First Mobile Application

This application is based on the problem that is pertinent in the startup culture and improving what we already have. In this idea-based network, we seek to allow users to seamlessly share their ideas, improvements, and suggestions for all to see that they might one day pursue something worth it and see the effects of it.

This is the official github repository for it, and we will be updating daily. If this project fails, then so be it.
